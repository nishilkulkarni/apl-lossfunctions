# Active Passive Loss (APL) Framework for Robust Deep Learning

## Description

The **Active Passive Loss (APL)** framework is a novel approach to training deep neural networks (DNNs) under noisy label conditions. APL combines two robust loss functions to address the challenges of underfitting and overfitting commonly seen with noisy data. By applying a simple normalization technique, APL ensures that any loss function can be made robust to label noise, while maintaining superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that APL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when noise rates are as high as 60% to 80%.
